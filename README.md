## earlyUsersAirdrop.json - preliminary list
Users that have deposited in any of the Avacash.Finance's Instance until the block 6985545.

**Note:** This is just a preliminary block, hence a **preliminary list**, the final list of early users will be taken when the Anonymity Mining program starts. You can still participate by depositing in any of the Avacash.Finance's instance until that date (to confirm).

The amount of cash tokens was calculated per `earlyUser` as follows:
- Only one deposit per early user per instance was considered.
- Each instance gives a different amount of points
  - 1 AVAX Instance: 1 point:
  - 10 AVAX Instance: 8 points:
  - 100 AVAX Instance: 16 points.

- CASH = (earlyUserPoints/totalPoints)*(20,000)

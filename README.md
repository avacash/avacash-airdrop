# avacash-airdrop

## earlyUsersAirdrop.json - FINAL LIST
Users that have deposited in any of the Avacash.Finance's Instance until block N°7974288 in Avalanche Mainnet, and until block N°3568234 in Fuji.

This was the previous block before the Avacash.Finance attack on December 10th 2021.

New audited Anonimity Pools will be launched directly with Anonymity Mining, so there won't be any early adopter program in the future.

The amount of cash tokens was calculated per `earlyAdopter` as follows:
- Only one deposit per early user per instance was considered.
- Each instance gives a different amount of points
  - 1 AVAX Instance: 1 point:
  - 10 AVAX Instance: 8 points:
  - 100 AVAX Instance: 16 points.

- `CASH = (earlyAdopterPoints/totalPoints)*(20,000)`
